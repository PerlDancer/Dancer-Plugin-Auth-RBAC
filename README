Dancer-Plugin-Authorize - Dancer Authentication and Role-Based Access Control Framework!

# FRAMEWORK SEPCIFICATION

Dancer::Plugin::Authorize is an authentication framework and role-based access control system.
As a role-based access control system Dancer::Plugin::Authorize give you the ultimate in flexibilty
and scalability.

# BASIC USAGE

use Dancer;
use Dancer::Plugin::Authorize;

post '/login' => sub {

    if (auth({ login => params->{user}, password => params->{pass} })) {
        
        if (auth_asa('guest')) {
            ...
        }
        
        if (auth_can('manage_accounts', 'create')) {
            ...
        }
        
    }

};

# CONFIGURATION SEPCIFICATION

Mainly under the Authorize plugin section in the configuration file you'll have a
keyword which defines all the authentication information needed, this keyword exists
solely to accomidate use-cases where multiple multiple authentication schemes are needed.
e.g. an application may need to authenticate different types of users differents, i.e.
users may need LDAP authentication and customers may need DBIC authentication. etc.

Dancer::Plugin::Authorize then creates the following functions using your keywords:

$keyword = 'foo';

# authentication function
foo()

# check if the authenticated user has the specified role
foo_asa($role)

# check if the authenticated user has permission to perform a specific action
foo_can($permission, $action)
